  about:
    "Currently in my second-year, I am a results-driven Computer Science undergraduate from SRM University. Frontend development and competitive programming are something that I love hustling on from the very core. Apart from this, I am a full stack web development enthusiast, I love coding and watching/playing football and cricket. I love working on the technical aspect of various things. I try to make learning as fun and practical as possible.Keeping ourselves restricted to entirely a single domain, shouldn't be the case. Being an explorer of all, but a master of one always helps. Exploring new horizons in different domains, discovering what you love, equating procrastination with your daily work is something that I appreciate.",
